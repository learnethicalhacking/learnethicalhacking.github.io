Welcome To Ethical Hacking
For Dummies

Beginner 1st Semester Course - Linux Basic Learning

## Getting Started

Linux is trash. Windows, on the other hand, has good performance, but it has to pay as much as the hardware price. The Windows operating system is compared to M-16 and the Linux operating system is AK-47. For those who don't have money, Linux is simply a way to make computers available.

Linux is made up of a lot of code that hacked Windows. And it's hidden in the name of countless anonymous contributors. These codes are inconvenient to use, but poor people without money are using them at the risk of performance degradation. That doesn't necessarily mean that the Windows operating system is good. MS Office does not improve the fundamental framework even if the version is changed, causing inconvenience to users. However, they are only busy releasing and selling new versions every year, and have no will to improve bugs. As a result, the performance of the fake MS Office in China has caught up with the real MS Office. The market share of the Linux operating system is increasing thanks to the elderly people of MS who are not willing to improve.

The purpose of learning computers for students in poor countries such as North Korea, Iran, India, and Africa is to learn hacking. In addition, these developing countries do not have a good Internet infrastructure. In such countries, it is not easy to receive more than four gigabytes of video lectures as in the U.K. and the U.S. If students in these countries want to watch video lectures, the video should be encoded and transmitted as small as possible.

The project is designed to make it easy for people in such countries to get access to video lectures that will help foster ethics about hacking. They have a conscience because they are human beings, not beasts like monkeys. The purpose of the project is to make it possible to control cybercrime desires with their own morality so that they do not use Linux, a cyber-AK-47 assault rifle in their hands for illegal purposes. I would like to thank those who donated a lot of time to create a lecture on ethical hacking.

### Prerequisites

Software required to watch video lectures

```
Chrome: Google’s Web browser, Mozilla Firefox for Windows, Microsoft Edge: Web Browser, and more (media play is available in any web browser that supports HTML5 web technology)
```

### Installing

This course is designed to learn ethical hacking.
Lectures are conducted in English, so students need at least 700 points of English on TOEIC.
This course consists of 12 semesters that take more than 12 months, one week per chapter.
At the beginning level, students will learn the operating system for hacking; at the intermediate level, they will learn the security environment needed for the hacker's survival; at the advanced level, they will learn hacking techniques.
Practice is essential, and even a single mistake on-site can have fatal consequences, so it is strongly recommended that you take repeated courses from the beginning to avoid mistakes.
All responsibility for the use of hacking technology for illegal purposes lies with the students.

## Running the tests

There is no way to run automated tests on the system. Watch and review each course.

### Break down into end to end tests

The following is an explanation of what this test is about and why.

```
Anyone can do it if you follow it step by step. Even those who have never encountered a computer language can follow it.
```

### And coding style tests

The following is an explanation of what this test is about and why.

```
Just as people have different ways of thinking and expressing, coding also has individual styles. The idea of logically optimized code that uses the least resources leads to true improvement.
```

## Deployment

It doesn't matter if you store it on your computer for personal learning purposes, but I don't think it's going to be possible to play it indiscriminately in public places.

## Built With
